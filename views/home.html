    <h4>Software Development Internship</h4>

            <h3>About the Internship</h3>
            <hr>
                <p>We are searching for a software development intern who is an innovative future-thinking
                dog-lover. At ZiggyCorp, it's all about the dog.</p><br>
            <h3>More About Us</h3>
            <hr>
                <p>We build products to help dogs relate to their families. One of the innovative projects
                    we have started is a database of ways in which dogs communicate. We plan to use this data to
                    develop a translation  algorithm for humans to be able to communicate with their beloved
                    four-legged friends. We are also working toward developing VR and AR virtual trainer apps.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Everyone here at ZiggyCorp loves dogs. We are a dog-friendly workplace, and we encourage all
                    of our team members to bring their dogs to work with them. We have a large dog run on our campus
                    and our break room is stocked full of healthy dog treats. We have a mobile groomer that comes in once
                    a week, at the company expense.
                </p><br>

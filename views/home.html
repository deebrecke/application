    <h4>Software Development Internship</h4>
        <p>Renton, WA, paid, 10 weeks</p>
        <div class="col-6">
            <h3>About the Internship</h3>
            <hr><!-- adds a horizontal line line-->
                <p>We are searching for a software development intern who is an innovative future-thinking
                dog-lover. At ZiggyCorp, it's all about the dog.</p><br>
            <h3>More About Us</h3>
            <hr>
                <p>Our software department builds products to help dogs relate to their families. One of the innovative projects
                    we have started is a database of ways in which dogs communicate. We plan to use this data to
                    develop a translation  algorithm for humans to be able to better communicate with their beloved
                    four-legged friends. We are also working toward developing VR and AR virtual trainer apps.
                </p>
                <p>In addition to our innovative software, we provide full-service care for all of our customers' dogs
                    needs. These services are on site and include veterinary services, trainers (behavioral and agility),
                    groomers, nutritionists, and boarding. We also have a great retail outlet with all the best treats,
                    food, toys, and equipment. Don't see it in the store? Just ask and we will order it. </p>
                <p>
                    Everyone here at ZiggyCorp loves dogs. Our offices are all dog-friendly, and we encourage all of our team members
                    to bring their dogs to work with them. As part of our benefits package, all team members receive vouchers to take
                    part in any of our dog services. When you bring your dog to work and need a break, you can board him for an hour or
                    even the whole day. You also have access to open the dog park (multiple dogs at a time),
                    the agility course, and the dog run (one dog at a time) any time you or your fur-baby need to get some energy out.
                </p><br>
